    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(team);
    console.log(players);

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
  
    team2[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team2);
    console.log(players);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain1 = person;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    // argument 1> empty(new) obj   2> obj to fold in   3> our own one

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const captain3 = {...person};  :  Not in js yet );

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
